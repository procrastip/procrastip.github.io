I"‰<p>You can strikethrough words by putting a horizontal line through the center of them. The result looks <del>like this</del>. This feature allows you to indicate that certain words are a mistake not meant for inclusion in the document. To strikethrough words, use two tilde symbols (<code class="highlighter-rouge">~~</code>) before and after the words.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~~The world is flat.~~ We now know that the world is round.
</code></pre></div></div>
