<p>My name is Luis Cinza and I founded Procrastip with the intention of giving back to the community. I am passionate about the topics of procrastination, motivation and focus, and I felt the need for something like this myself, so I thought this was an interesting idea that is also initially easy to implement. Iâ€™m not an academic nor claim to be an expert on the topic. For now, these strategies are what worked for me over the years. Over time, I want this project to evolve to being something created by everyone to everyone, in line with the principles outlined above.</p>

<h3 id="how-did-you-come-with-the-principles-of-the-website">How did you come with the principles of the website?</h3>
<p>Principles #1 and #2 make it easier to create a new habit that promotes maximum performance. Principles #3 and #4 are the pillars of a respectful and people-driven use of the Internet. Itâ€™s also worth mentioning that Procrastip wonâ€™t link to any other websites or resources that do not follow similar principles.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-you-choose-this-platform-over-others">Why did you choose this platform over others?</h3>
<p>I considered multiple online and offline â€˜platformsâ€™ to host this content but ultimately none of them helped better achieve principles #1 to #4 as a standalone website.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-reach-out">How can I reach out?</h3>
<p>You can reach out via email to procrastip at protonmail.com. Please share any improvement ideas and suggestions, regarding the content or technical aspects of the project. I would also be happy to know how the website helped you achieve done.</p>
