<h3 id="get-the-basics-right">Get the basics right</h3>
<ul>
  <li>‚≠ê <strong>Move away from all sources of distraction.</strong> Block distracting websites and apps. Turn off all electronics and place close to them ‚Äì for example, the power or home button ‚Äì a written note with the time when you will be allowed to use them again, so that you won‚Äôt forget.</li>
  <li>‚≠ê <strong>Drink water.</strong> While you‚Äôre at it, you can also take some vitamins (e.g. magnesium).</li>
  <li><strong>Have a healthy meal or a snack if you‚Äôre hungry.</strong> No sugar or refined carbs allowed.</li>
  <li><strong>Move to and/or organize your ‚Äòworkspace‚Äô.</strong> If you want to start a fitness exercise, try putting yourself in fitness clothes and preparing the equipment. If you want to write a document on your computer, clean your desk, close all windows and open the text editor and any other notes, research or other resources you may need. You might need to move to a physical space that promotes concentration (e.g. another room, a library, a coffee shop) or the completion of whatever task you are avoiding.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="shift-your-mood">Shift your mood</h3>
<ul>
  <li>‚≠ê <strong>Meditate.</strong> Force yourself to do it until you‚Äôre in the right mood. Ideally, meditation is all you need to regain focus.</li>
  <li><strong>Try one of these mood improving activities:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Listen to music</strong> that you enjoy, that makes you happy or that makes you focus.</li>
      <li><strong>Have a walk</strong>, especially around nature. You could also ask a friend or colleague to join or even have a call or walking meeting while you do so.</li>
      <li><strong>Read an easy book.</strong> In doing so, you will slowly improve your attention span.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dive-deeper">Dive deeper</h3>
<ul>
  <li>‚≠ê <strong>Identify why you are procrastinating.</strong> Work on the problem yourself. If you start reading articles or books or watching videos or podcasts on how to fix this problem, you‚Äôll just go down the spiral of procrastination. Ultimately, you know ‚Äì consciously or not ‚Äì what‚Äôs going on and you have all resources you need to take back ownership over your actions and get things done. Write down the answers to the following questions:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Activity:</strong> What is the activity I am putting off? How will I know I stopped procrastinating?</li>
      <li><strong>Stakes:</strong> What is at stake? What‚Äôs the worst that can happen if I don‚Äôt do this activity? List all the reasons for not doing a task and all the reasons for getting it done.</li>
      <li><strong>First act of delay:</strong> When you first delayed acting on the activity, how were you feeling and what were you thinking? How did you rationalize that it was ok to keep procrastinating?</li>
      <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Why did I start procrastinating? What prevents you from getting started? A few reasons: you don‚Äôt care anymore about the goals you had committed to achieve, you‚Äôre burned out and feel depleted, you just don‚Äôt know what to do next, other things seemed to be more important, the task is not pleasurable, you are lacking confidence in your ability to accomplish it, you‚Äôre overwhelmed, you don‚Äôt know where to start, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Solution:</strong> How will I fix it? What are the next steps?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p><strong>Who is behind the website?</strong> I‚Äôm Luis Cinza (Product Manager, based in Europe) and founded Procrastip with the intention of giving back to the community. I am passionate about the topics of procrastination, motivation and focus, and I felt the need for something like this myself, so I thought this was an interesting idea that is also initially easy to implement. I‚Äôm not an academic nor claim to be an expert on the topic. For now, these strategies are what worked for me over the years. Over time, I want this project to evolve to being something created by everyone to everyone, in line with the principles outlined above.</p>

<p><strong>How did you come with the principles of the website?</strong> I insist on principles #1 and #2 because they make it easier to create a new habit that promotes maximum performance. I insist on principles #3 and #4 because I feel they should be the pillars of a respectful and people-driven use of the Internet. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that Procrastip won‚Äôt link to any other websites or resources that do not follow similar principles.</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose this platform over others?</strong> I considered multiple platforms to host this content (book, e-book, blog article, wiki, discussion, forums, etc.) but none of them followed all the principles #1 to #4 outlined above.</p>

<p><strong>How can I reach out?</strong> You can reach out via email to procrastip at protonmail.com. Please share any improvement ideas and suggestions, regarding the content or technical aspects of the project. I would also be happy to know how the website helped you achieve done.</p>
