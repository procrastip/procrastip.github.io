<h3 id="line-break-best-practices">Line Break Best Practices</h3>

<p>You can use two or more spaces (referred to as ‚Äútrailing whitespace‚Äù) for line breaks in nearly every Markdown application, but it‚Äôs controversial. It‚Äôs hard to see trailing whitespace in an editor, and many people accidentally or intentionally put two spaces after every sentence. For this reason, you may want to use something other than trailing whitespace for line breaks. Fortunately, there is another option supported by nearly every Markdown application: the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;br&gt;</code> HTML tag.</p>

<p>For compatibility, use trailing white space or the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;br&gt;</code> HTML tag at the end of the line.</p>

<p>There are two other options I don‚Äôt recommend using. CommonMark and a few other lightweight markup languages let you type a backslash (<code class="highlighter-rouge">\</code>) at the end of the line, but not all Markdown applications support this, so it isn‚Äôt a great option from a compatibility perspective. And at least a couple lightweight markup languages don‚Äôt require anything at the end of the line ‚Äî just type return and they‚Äôll create a line break.</p>
