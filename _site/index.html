<p>Items with a ‚≠ê are our favorite tactics.</p>

<h2 id="-get-the-basics-right">üìå Get the basics right</h2>
<ul>
  <li>‚≠ê <strong>Move away from all sources of distraction.</strong> Block distracting websites and apps. Turn off all electronics and place close to them ‚Äì for example, the power or home button ‚Äì a written note with the time when you will be allowed to use them again, so that you won‚Äôt forget.</li>
  <li>‚≠ê <strong>Drink water.</strong> While you‚Äôre at it, you can also take some vitamins (e.g. magnesium).</li>
  <li><strong>Have a healthy meal or a snack if you‚Äôre hungry.</strong> No sugar or refined carbs allowed.</li>
  <li><strong>Move to and/or organize your ‚Äòworkspace‚Äô.</strong> If you want to start a fitness exercise, try putting yourself in fitness clothes and preparing the equipment. If you want to write a document on your computer, clean your desk, close all windows and open the text editor and any other notes, research or other resources you may need. You might need to move to a physical space that promotes concentration (e.g. another room, a library, a coffee shop) or the completion of whatever task you are avoiding.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-shift-your-mood">üòÉ Shift your mood</h2>
<ul>
  <li>‚≠ê <strong>Meditate.</strong> Force yourself to do it until you‚Äôre in the right mood. Ideally, meditation is all you need to regain focus.</li>
  <li><strong>Try one of these mood improving activities:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Listen to music</strong> that you enjoy, that makes you happy or that makes you focus.</li>
      <li><strong>Have a walk</strong>, especially around nature. You could also ask a friend or colleague to join or even have a call or walking meeting while you do so.</li>
      <li><strong>Read an easy book.</strong> In doing so, you will slowly improve your attention span.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Ô∏è-dive-deeper">‚úèÔ∏è Dive deeper</h2>
<ul>
  <li>‚≠ê <strong>Identify why you are procrastinating.</strong> Work on the problem yourself. If you start reading articles or books or watching videos or podcasts on how to fix this problem, you‚Äôll just go down the spiral of procrastination. Ultimately, you know ‚Äì consciously or not ‚Äì what‚Äôs going on and you have all resources you need to take back ownership over your actions and get things done. Write down the answers to the following questions:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Activity:</strong> What is the activity I am putting off? How will I know I stopped procrastinating?</li>
      <li><strong>Stakes:</strong> What is at stake? What‚Äôs the worst that can happen if I don‚Äôt do this activity? List all the reasons for not doing a task and all the reasons for getting it done.</li>
      <li><strong>First act of delay:</strong> When you first delayed acting on the activity, how were you feeling and what were you thinking? How did you rationalize that it was ok to keep procrastinating?</li>
      <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Why did I start procrastinating? What prevents you from getting started? A few reasons: you don‚Äôt care anymore about the goals you had committed to achieve, you‚Äôre burned out and feel depleted, you just don‚Äôt know what to do next, other things seemed to be more important, the task is not pleasurable, you are lacking confidence in your ability to accomplish it, you‚Äôre overwhelmed, you don‚Äôt know where to start, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Solution:</strong> How will I fix it? What are the next steps? (Read the <a href="#get-started">Get Started section</a> for practices that you can generally follow and <a href="#ideas">Additional ideas section</a> section for practices that help address particular causes.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="get-started">üí™ Get started</h2>

<ul>
  <li>‚≠ê <strong>Start with the task you keep putting off. Break it down into specific, tiny and actionable pieces.</strong> If you start with the most difficult task, you‚Äôll feel unbeatable for the rest of the day. If it‚Äôs really off-putting, try something easier to get momentum.</li>
  <li>‚≠ê <strong>Take the easiest step, and do it first. Do it for 2 minutes. If that seems too much, break it down even further.</strong> Just open that file. Just write the first line. Then go on to the next easiest step.</li>
  <li>‚≠ê <strong>Commit doing it and establish a reward.</strong> Establish what you will need to do and be specific in the metrics and deadlines ‚Äì it should be clear whether you were successful or not. <strong>Set up immediate consequences for your behavior and do not create any exceptions.</strong> Set daily rewards for completing a set of tasks, such as setting money aside to buy something, eat something yummy or watch a movie. You can also try punishments such as donating money to a political cause you don‚Äôt relate to, abstain from doing certain activities you like or forcing yourself to complete some chores you dislike. (Some research suggests rewards/intrinsic motivators alone work better than having both rewards/intrinsic motivations and punishments/extrinsic motivators.)</li>
  <li><strong>Reconnect with your purpose.</strong>
o	What is the most important problem that you could act on right now?
o	You‚Äôre giving a speech 5 years from now. What topic would you choose?
o	What would you do if money were no object?</li>
  <li><strong>Ask for feedback from others.</strong> They will likely give you a vision and tell you what you are doing right and wrong. Their feedback will likely be actionable on loads of things you can do to improve the current situation and move ahead with key projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Start somewhere other than the beginning.</strong> If the beginning is causing you difficulty, skip it and move on to something you can do right away.</li>
  <li><strong>If a task is unpleasant, make it more challenging and fun.</strong> Challenge yourself to break your speed record or to find a more efficient way to perform this task. Re-frame it to make it more acceptable to do.</li>
  <li><strong>Attack the problem as if you were a master at getting things done.</strong> Pretend you are someone you know whose accomplishments consistently impress you. What actions would they take?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ideas">üí° Additional ideas</h2>
<p>Please don‚Äôt use these additional activities as a way to keep procrastinating. See them as practices to solve particular root causes, to be used conservatively. Push yourself harder and go over and follow the tactics in the <a href="#get-started">Get Started section</a> once more.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>IF YOU FEEL PHYSICALLY TIRED:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Take a nap.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Drink tea or coffee.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>IF YOU DON‚ÄôT CARE ANYMORE:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Focus on improving the process and make it work for you.</strong> Ignore the goals and the stakes.</li>
      <li><strong>Say ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do this anymore‚Äù.</strong> Once you lift the pressure of ‚Äúyou have to do it‚Äù and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing it anymore‚Äù, you can think further on why you want to do it, rather than why you have to do it, and you‚Äôll know whether it is really worth pursuing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>IF YOU NEED TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO NEXT OR WHERE TO START:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Write out your options and pick something randomly.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Prioritize.</strong> What‚Äôs the worst thing that can happen if you procrastinate and fail to complete this task? What is the best possible result of getting it done on time? Now, do the right thing.</li>
      <li><strong>Start somewhere other than the beginning.</strong> Sometimes it‚Äôs best to just get started at any point on a project. If the beginning is causing you difficulty, skip it and move on to something you can do right away.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>IF YOU‚ÄôRE BURNED OUT AND FEEL DEPLETED:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Do one or two things you enjoy.</strong> This helps you feel rested and brings back ownership over your life. For example:
        <ul>
          <li>Exercise.</li>
          <li>Talk to a colleague, a friend or a family member.</li>
          <li>Complete something creative.</li>
          <li>Take a shower.</li>
          <li>Watch a TV show, movie or comedy show.</li>
          <li>Play a game.</li>
          <li>Watch light, funny, insightful interviews from others.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-it-worked">‚úî It worked!</h2>
<p>Awesome! Here are some more tips to stay motivated:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Extend your commitments for the next few days.</strong> Don‚Äôt forget to keep rewards as short-term as possible, ideally ‚Äòunlocked‚Äô at least once a day.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete Pomodoros with a twist.</strong> Work on tasks for a period of time, e.g. 25 minutes, followed by a short period of rest, e.g. 5 minutes, and repeat ‚Äì this is the basic version of the Pomodoro technique. Aim to finish each Pomodoro at a point I‚Äôll be excited to return to the task later.</li>
  <li><strong>Schedule tasks according to your productivity cycle. Mix difficult tasks with easier ones.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Create streaks of days on which you complete your goals.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-it-didnt-work">üõë It didn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶</h2>
<p>Oh no! Here‚Äôs a few things you can do instead:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Allow yourself to get bored.</strong> At some point, the task you are procrastinating might become less boring than your current state.</li>
  <li><strong>Procrastinate productively.</strong> We can achieve good things while we avoid doing great things. Sometimes, those are the times we are the most productive or innovative. If you want to see opportunities you‚Äôre not seeing, instead of procrastinating in front of the TV or social networks, shut them down and think a little. At first, it‚Äôs boring. Then, there are two alternatives: procrastination is more boring than the task you‚Äôre delaying or you‚Äôll have some interesting idea.</li>
  <li><strong>Take a break.</strong> Be flexible. Sometimes, strong resistance means there‚Äôs other factors at play and occasionally not feeling like working is completely fine. Sometimes you really need a break. Doing less today just means you‚Äôll need to do more tomorrow and in the upcoming days. You can handle it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-final-thoughts">üôè Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Above all, be happy and thankful that you are trying to become better. Write down your journey and track your improvement over time. I really hope that this guide helped you today. Have a great day and come back at any time!</p>
